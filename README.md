# Madoka Population

A simulation of the witch / magical girl population as seen in [a certain magical girl anime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica).

You can start with a population of magical girls and witches already in place and observe the system from there, or you can just specify the number of Incubators at the start and let things evolve organically.

Start up with `lein run resources/config_scheme.edn`. The file `resources/config_scheme.edn` has all the starting settings, e.g. how many witches, magical girls, and incubators to start out with.

The code is mine. Use it as you please, but do attribute it to me (even if
your use is submitting to The Daily WTF, still attribute it to me).

This is a fan work. The anime does not belong to me. If you want to do something with it, you'll have to take it up with some large corporation in Japan. Hope you know your kanji!
